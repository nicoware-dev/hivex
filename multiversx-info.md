Architecture Overview
MultiversX is a high-throughput public blockchain aimed at providing security, efficiency, scalability and interoperability, beyond the current state-of-the-art. The two most important features that set MultiversX apart are Adaptive State Sharding and the Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.

MultiversX is a complete redesign of blockchain architecture with the aim to achieve global scalability and near instant transaction speed. MultiversX's architecture rests on the following key innovations:

Adaptive State Sharding on all levels: transaction, data and network. The dynamically adaptive sharding mechanism will perform shard merging and shard splitting while taking into consideration both the number of available validator nodes and also the network usage.
Secure Proof of Stake Consensus, completed in just two communication steps, using modified Boneh–Lynn–Shacham ("BLS") multi-signatures among the validators of the consensus group. Moreover, nodes inside the shard are randomly selected for the consensus group with no possibility of knowing the group's composition more than one round in advance.
High resiliency to malicious attacks due to periodical node reshuffling across shards. Every epoch, up to 1/3 of the nodes in every shard are reshuffled to other shards in order to prevent collusion.
Secure randomness source with BLS signing, which makes it non-biasable and unpredictable.
The MultiversX WASM VM, an exceptionally fast virtual machine for executing smart contracts written in any programming language that can compile to WebAssembly.
Smart contracts on a sharded state architecture, with balanced load on shards. This is a requirement for a high-throughput blockchain platform. Balancing smart contracts across shards allows MultiversX to run multiple SCs in parallel, while the cross-shard calls are handled by an asynchronous cross-shard execution process.
Fast finality for cross-shard transactions in mere seconds. Having a very high TPS is required for a high throughput blockchain solution, but TPS is only half the picture: fast finality for cross-shard transactions is of crucial importance. Most existing state-of-the-art blockchain architectures refuse to mention this aspect, but from a user standpoint it is extremely important. Fast cross-shard finality is naturally handled by MultiversX at the protocol level, using a dispatching algorithm and a routing protocol.




Consensus
MultiversX's approach for consensus is called Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS). It innovates in the manner in which validator nodes are selected for consensus out of a shard and also in the steps taken by the validators to complete the consensus process as efficiently as possible. Let's take a look.

At the beginning of each round, SPoS selects validators for consensus using a randomness source that can be neither predicted, nor influenced. It is surprisingly simple, requiring only to be calculated from the previous block and to be signed by the consensus leader of the current round (also known as the block proposer). The resulting signature will be the randomness source for the next round, and due to its reliance on the immediately preceding block, it cannot be known more than a round in advance.

In each round, a new consensus group is selected to propose a block. But only one validator in the group will be the block proposer. This is the validator in the consensus group which has the hash of the public key and randomness source is the smallest, numerically. The block proposer will produce the block for the round, and the rest of the consensus group will validate and sign it.

The time necessary for random selection of the consensus group is exceptionally short (around 100 ms, often less). This efficiency is a consequence of the fact that consensus selection is deterministic once the randomness source is known, thus there is no communication requirement. This allows total round times on the order of mere seconds.

There is a security advantage to having rounds this short: SPoS is built on the premise that a malevolent actor cannot adapt faster than the timeframe allowed by a round in order to influence the block that will be proposed.

Like other Proof of Stake methods, SPoS selects validator nodes for consensus based on the amount of EGLD tokens staked by their operators. Additionally, each validator has an individual rating score that is taken into account - stake alone may only influence, but not completely determine the selection for consensus. Rating expresses the past behavior of the specific validator and is taken into account during consensus selection: validators with a higher rating are more likely to be selected. The rating of a validator is recalculated at the end of each epoch, with a few specific exceptions when rating is adjusted immediately. This way, SPoS promotes meritocracy among validators, encouraging their operators to keep them running smoothly.





Sharding
Sharding was first used in databases and is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. This makes it a scaling technique, and can be used by blockchain networks to partition states and transaction processing, so that each node of the network would only need to process a fraction of all the transactions. Moreover, sharding allows for the parallel processing of transactions. As long as there is a sufficient number of nodes verifying each transaction, ensuring high reliability and security, then splitting a blockchain into shards will allow it to process far more transactions by means of parallelization, and thus greatly improving transaction throughput and efficiency. Moreover, sharding promises to increase the throughput of the network as it expands and the number of validator grows - a property called horizontal scaling.

Sharding types
We emphasize the three main types of sharding: network sharding, transaction sharding and state sharding, described in the next paragraphs.

Network sharding handles the way the nodes are grouped into shards and can be used to optimize communication, as message propagation inside a shard can be done much faster than propagation to the entire network. This is the first challenge in every sharding approach and the mechanism that maps nodes to shards has to take into consideration the possible attacks from an attacker that gains control over a specific shard.

Transaction sharding handles the way the transactions are mapped to the shards where they will be processed. In an account-based system, the transactions could be assigned to shards based on the sender's address.

State sharding is the most challenging approach. In contrast to the previously described sharding mechanisms, where all nodes store the entire state, in the case of state-sharded blockchains each shard maintains only a portion of the state. If the accounts involved in a transaction reside in different shards, executing that transaction will require the state to be updated in both shards and will involve the exchange of messages between the nodes of the two shards. In order to increase resiliency to malicious attacks, the nodes in the shards have to be reshuffled from time to time. However, moving nodes between shards introduces synchronization overheads, that is, the time taken for the newly added nodes to download the latest state from their new shard. Thus, it is imperative that only a subset of all nodes should be redistributed during each epoch, to prevent down times during the synchronization process.

Sharding directions
Some sharding proposals attempt to focus on transaction sharding or state sharding alone, which increases transaction's throughput, either by forcing every node to store lots of state data or each node to be a supercomputer.

Sharding introduces some new challenges, such as the single-shard takeover attack, potentially intensive cross-shard communication, overall data availability and also the need of an abstraction layer that hides the shards. However, given that the above problems are addressed correctly, state sharding brings considerable overall improvements: transaction throughput will increase significantly due to parallel transaction processing and transaction fees will be considerably reduced. These two criteria are widely considered to be the main obstacles against mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. MultiversX has undertaken the task of transforming these obstacles into advantages and incentives towards massive mainstream adoption.

The MultiversX sharding approach
Goals
Sharding in the MultiversX network was designed from the ground up to address the complexity of combining network sharding, transaction sharding and state sharding. The result is a cohesive protocol design, which not only achieves full sharding, but attains the following goals as well:

Scalability without affecting availability, which requires that increasing or decreasing the number of shards should only affect a negligibly small vicinity of nodes without causing down-times, or minimizing them while updating states.
Fast dispatching and instant traceability, which requires that computing the destination shard of a transaction must be deterministic and also trivial to calculate, eliminating the need for communication rounds.
Efficiency and adaptability, which requires that the shards should be as balanced as possible at any given time.




MultiversX Virtual Machine (SpaceVM)
The execution of SmartContracts plays a central role in modern blockchain networks. MultiversX built a fast and secure virtual machine for this purpose.

Because the MultiversX VM executes WebAssembly, it also means that it can execute smart contracts written in any programming language that can be compiled to WASM bytecode. Though, we only provide support for writing contracts in Rust.

Developers are encouraged to use Rust for their smart contracts, however. MultiversX provides a Rust framework which allows for unusually clean and efficient code in smart contracts, a rarity in the blockchain field. A declarative testing framework is bundled as well.

Features
The MultiversX VM was built to be as fast and secure as possible, but without adding unneeded restrictions to what smart contracts can do: the API provided by the VM, called the MultiversX Environment Interface, is comprehensive and easy to use.

Statelessness
The MultiversX WASM VM is a stateless VM. When a smart contract is being executed, it is not allowed to write directly neither to the blockchain, nor to the storage. This is an important design decision, because it obviates the need for reverting operations. So, instead of writing directly to the state, the API will accumulate the changes introduced by the smart contract execution into a transient data structure, which is then applied to the storage and / or blockchain, but only at the end of the execution, and only in case of success. Reading the global state is, of course, permitted at any time.

In effect, the global state remains unaffected until the execution ends.

Fast execution engine
The MultiversX VM executes code using Wasmer as an execution engine, which operates as a just-in-time streaming compiler. Due to the design of Wasmer, the smart contracts are executed at near-native speed.

The version of Wasmer that is embedded in the VM has been modified to add accurate metering with configurable cost per individual WASM opcode. But apart from metering, MultiversX has also modified Wasmer to allow for preemptive execution control at runtime, whereby a smart contract can be stopped immediately by the VM, if needed. Moreover, the compilation efficiency has been improved, and floating-point operations have been forbidden, to ensure strict determinism.

Asynchronous calls between contracts
Smart contracts may call each other using the VM's asynchronous API. Because the MultiversX Network is sharded adaptively, it may happen that a smart contract will end up calling another smart contract stored by a different shard. This is handled easily by the MultiversX VM, and the smart contract developer never has to care about shards.

In case a contract calls another, and they are both in the same shard, the execution is effectively synchronous, and both contracts are executed without even leaving the VM.

If the contracts happen to be in different shards, no worries - the execution will be automatically switched to an asynchronous mode, the call is sent to its destination shard, executed there, and then the flow finally returns to the caller.

Both the synchronous and asynchronous modes are invisible to the smart contract developer: the API is the same for both, and the switch happens at runtime, when needed.



Economics Overview
The MultiversX blockchain economy is designed around eGold (EGLD) - a powerful digital currency positioned for global adoption.

eGold, or EGLD, is the native coin of the network.

It is paid by users and developers to transfer value and assets, create and manage tokens, deploy and call smart contracts, and other similar operations

It is earned by validators, the set of internet computers that run and secure the network and help it reach consensus

This circular digital economy revolves around EGLD, which has a maximum theoretical supply of 31,415,926 EGLD.

In the bootstrapping phase of the MultiversX blockchain 20,000,000 EGLD coins were initially minted. Additional EGLD are gradually released into circulation over a period of 10 years until the maximum theoretical limit is reached.

The EGLD minting - or “inflation” - is offset by the sum of the transaction fees. As an example, if 100,000 EGLD are to be minted as per the inflation schedule in Year X, but the network-wide sum of the transaction fees for Year X are 75,000 EGLD, only 25,000 new EGLD will enter into circulation.
