# Multi-Agent System Architecture 🤖

HiveX's power comes from its innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture, where multiple AI agents work together harmoniously to deliver a comprehensive DeFAI experience. This document explains how our MAS works and why it's a game-changer for DeFi operations. Want to see our agents in action? Check out our [User Guide](./user-guide.md) or explore our complete [Agents Directory](./agents.md).

## Why Multi-Agent Systems? 🎯

Traditional DeFi tools often use single-purpose bots or monolithic systems. Our multi-agent approach offers several key advantages:

- **Specialization**: Each agent excels at specific tasks, leading to better performance
- **Redundancy**: Multiple agents can handle similar tasks, ensuring system reliability
- **Scalability**: New agents can be added without disrupting existing operations
- **Flexibility**: Agents can be updated or replaced individually
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Agents collaborate to solve complex problems

## Our Agent Architecture 🏗️

### Core Components

1. **Orchestration Layer**
   - n8n as the primary coordination and orchestration system.
   - ElizaOS as the main agentic framework for protocols and tools integration.

2. **Agent Types**
   - Internal
   - Public
   - Private
