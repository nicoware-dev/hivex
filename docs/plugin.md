## Implementation

```typescript
import { HiveXActions } from '@elizaos/plugin-hivex';

// Initialize the plugin
const hivex = new HiveXActions();

// Example: Get wallet balance
const balance = await hivex.getBalance('erd1...');

// Example: Swap tokens
const swap = await hivex.swapTokens({
  from: 'EGLD',
  to: 'USDC',
  amount: '0.1',
  slippage: '0.5'
});
```

## Architecture

The plugin is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into:
- **API Client Base:** Handles communication with MultiversX's blockchain nodes
- **Module-specific Functionality:** Organized by blockchain module (bank, staking, governance, etc.)
- **Actions:** High-level operations that agents can perform
- **Providers:** Data sources and service integrations
- **Templates:** Response formatting for consistent user experience

## Extending the Plugin

The plugin's modular design makes it easy to extend with new features:
1. Add new module functionality in the appropriate module file
2. Create new actions that leverage the module functionality
3. Update or create templates for formatting responses
4. Register new actions in the plugin's main export
