# One-Click Deployment

## One-click local sovereign deployment in Digital Ocean

At present, the only one-click deployment option is available on the Digital Ocean marketplace. This solution sets up a droplet containing a local Sovereign Chain connected to the MultiversX public testnet, complete with all essential services such as API, wallet, explorer, and more.

### Create Sovereign Chain droplet

- Go to [Digital Ocean marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/multiversx-testnet-sovereign-chain) for more info and to create your Sovereign Chain droplet.

:::note
It is recommended to choose a droplet with minimum 8 CPUs and 32GB RAM for the best performance.

The one-click deployment setup provided in this guide is designed primarily for development purposes. By default, it connects to the MultiversX public testnet and runs all services on the same machine. This setup is equivalent to the Full Local Setup but operates in the cloud, providing a convenient way to test and develop your Sovereign Chain in a hosted environment.
