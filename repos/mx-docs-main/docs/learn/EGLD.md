title: What is EGLD?
---

EGLD is the native cryptocurrency of MultiversX, functioning as digital, global money. It's the primary asset used within the MultiversX ecosystem.

### Key Features of EGLD

- **Ownership:** EGLD allows you to be your own bank, with full control over your funds.
- **Security:** Protected by cryptography, exists under your own account, ensuring the safety of your funds and transactions.
- **Decentralized:** No central authority controls EGLD, making it a truly decentralized currency.
- **Accessibility:** All you need is an internet connection and a wallet to use EGLD.
- **Flexibility:** EGLD can be divided into small units (as small as 0.000000000000000001), allowing for transactions of any size.
- **Payments:** Sending EGLD without any intermediary, everything directly on-chain, is like being face-to-face and handing cash over.

### Unique Aspects of EGLD

:::important
EGLD is the lifeblood of MultiversX. When you send EGLD or use a MultiversX application, you'll pay a fee in EGLD to use the network. This fee incentivizes validators to process and verify transactions.

Validators, the record-keepers of MultiversX, ensure no one is cheating. They are selected to propose blocks of transactions and are rewarded with EGLD.

The work validators do, and the capital they stake, keeps MultiversX secure and decentralized. **EGLD powers MultiversX.**

When you stake your EGLD, you help secure the network and earn rewards. The threat of losing staked EGLD deters attackers. [More on staking](/validators/staking).
