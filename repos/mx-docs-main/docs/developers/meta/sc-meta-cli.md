## Introduction

As mentioned [before](/developers/meta/sc-meta#standalone-tool-vs-contract-tool), the meta tool comes in two flavors, one for the individual contract (based on the contract's ABI), and the other as a standalone tool.

We will go through the CLI of both of these flavors.

## Standalone tool CLI

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### The `all` command

But first, there is a special feature that needs additional explanation: the `sc-meta all ...` command.

The standalone and the contract tools are not completely separate: the standalone tool can control multiple smart contract projects in a single command.

This is where the `all` command comes in: all it does is find all contracts in a given folder and call the contract tool for each of them with the given arguments.

For example:
- `sc-meta all abi` will generate the ABIs for all contracts;
- `sc-meta all build --locked` will build all contracts, with the crate versions given by Cargo.lock;
- `sc-meta all clean` will clean all projects;
- etc.

You can call `sc-meta all help` and see that the CLI docs are almost the same as those of the individual contract tool.

A related command is the `info` command, which just prints a tree with all the contract and contract libraries in a folder, without doing anything to them.

:::info Note
Since the CLI of the individual contract tool is available in the standalone tool, the following two commands are equivalent:

```
cd my-contract
sc-meta all build
```

```
cd my-contract/meta
cargo run build
```
:::

Parameters:
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to call all contract meta crates.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--ignore`
    - Ignore all directories with these names.
    - _default_: `target`.
- `--no-abi-git-version`
    - Skips loading the Git version into the ABI
- `--target-dir-meta`
    - For the meta crates, allows specifying the target directory where the Rust compiler will build the intermediary files. Sharing the same target directory can speed up building multiple contract crates at once.
    - _default_: uses the workspace, or builds in `meta/target`.
- `--target-dir-all`
    - Overrides both the `--target-dir-meta` and the `--target-dir-wasm` args.

### Calling `info`

The info command prints an overview of the contracts and libraries and residing under a folder. It also prints their framework versions.

As an example, below is the output of calling it in the example contract folder in the framework:

![sc-meta info screenshot](/developers/sc-meta/sc-meta-info.png "Result of calling sc-meta info in the example contract folder in the framework")

Parameters:
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to call all contract meta crates.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--ignore`
    - Ignore all directories with these names.
    - _default_: `target`.

### Calling `upgrade`

Calling `sc-meta upgrade` will try to automatically alter the code of a contract or group of contracts to make it/them compatible with the latest rust framework version.

The oldest version currently supported is `0.28.0`. Any older than that, and the developer will need to manually upgrade it to `0.28.0`.

It is especially important when upgrading from `0.38` to `0.39.0`, since a lot of changes happened at that point.

:::tip
For projects with multiple contract crates, we recommend upgrading all of them at once. The upgrade algorithm goes step by step, version after version. For some of the major versions, it also checks that the project compiles before moving on. This is to give developers the chance to fix issues manually, if necessary, and not have those issues pile up. If there are local dependencies between contracts, the upgrader will not be able to do the check unless all of them are upgraded together.
:::

:::caution
Generally, we strongly recommend to ensure code versioning or at least a backup of the contract code to avoid the impossibility of reverting permanent changes. This automatic code altering process involved in using `sc-meta upgrade` highly raises this recommendation.
:::

Parameters:
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to call all contract meta crates.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--ignore`
    - Ignore all directories with these names.
    - _default_: `target`.
- `--to`
    - Overrides the version to upgrade to.
    - _default_: the last released version.
- `--no-check`
    - By default `upgrade` compile checks the project after each major version upgrade. This is to allow developers that upgrade multiple versions to address issues with the upgrade before too many such issues get to accumulate. This feature can be turned off by the `--no-check` flag.
    - _default_: project is compiled.

### Calling `local-deps`

Calling `sc-meta local-deps` will create in each contract a report of the local dependencies between contracts and libraries. This helps with the reproducible builds, but might be extended in the future for other uses.

Example output (abridged):
```json
{
    "root": "/home/user/multiversx/mx-exchange-sc/",
    "contractPath": "/home/user/multiversx/mx-exchange-sc/dex/pair",
    "commonDependencyPath": "/home/user/multiversx/mx-exchange-sc",
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "path": "common/common_errors",
            "depth": 1
        },
        {
            "path": "common/common_structs",
            "depth": 1
        },
        {
            "path": "common/modules/legacy_token_decode_module",
            "depth": 3
        },
        {
            "path": "common/modules/locking_module",
            "depth": 2
        },
        {
            "path": "common/modules/math",
            "depth": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

Parameters:
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to call all contract meta crates.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--ignore`
    - Ignore all directories with these names.
    - _default_: `target`.

### Calling `new`

<!-- TODO: expand section and move to a separate page -->

Creates a new smart contract project from a standard template.

The tool will replace all necessary names in the project, based on the the project name given by the user. These include:
- the crate name,
- the contract trait name,
- the file name of the main source file.

Parameters:
- `--template`
    - The contract template to clone. Available options can be retrieve by using [this](/developers/meta/sc-meta-cli#calling-templates)
    - Required.
- `--name`
    - The new name the contract is to receive.
    - _default_: If missing, the template name will be kept.
- `--tag`
    -  The framework version on which the contracts should be created.
    - _default_: The latest released version.
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to create the new contract directory.
    - _default_: current directory.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `templates`

This command lists all available templates. As of framework version 0.43.2, they are:

```
crypto-zombies
empty
adder
```

Parameter:
- `--tag`
    -  The framework version on which the contracts should be created.
    - _default_: The latest released version.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `test`

This command is a useful shorthand for running various types of tests.

Parameters:
- `--path`  
    - Target directory where to generate contract integration tests.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--go`            
    - Use this argument to only run the mx-scenario-go tool, directly. It is equivalent to running `mx-scenario-go run`.
    - You can find out how to install `mx-scenario-go` [here](/developers/meta/sc-meta-cli#calling-install).
    - _default_: `false`
- `--scen`          
    - This argument causes cargo test to be run with the `multiversx-sc-scenario/run-go-tests` feature, causing tests relying on the mx-scenairo-go tool to also be run.
    - _default_: `false`
    - If `scen` and `go` are both specified, scen overrides the go argument.
- `--nocapture`    
    - This argument prints the entire output of the vm.
    - _default_: `false`
- `--help`        
    - Print help
- `--version`      
    - Print version

### Calling `test-gen`

The `test-gen` tool is used to [generate boilerplate](/developers/testing/scenario/running-scenarios#auto-generating-the-boilerplate) code when [integrating JSON scenario files in a contract's Rust test suite](/developers/testing/scenario/running-scenarios#integration-in-rust).

In short:

Contracts often have JSON scenario tests associated with them, which normally reside in the `scenarios` folder, under the contract crate root.

In order to execute them as part of the CI, it is helpful to generate a Rust test for each of them. The `test-gen` tool does just that.

These integration tests come in two flavors:
- Rust tests, that exclusively use the Rust debugger infrastructure;
- VM tests that use the Go infrastructure.

Read more about JSON scenarios in smart contract projects [here](/developers/testing/scenario/running-scenarios).

Parameters:
- `--path`
    - Target directory where to call all contract meta crates.
    - _default_: current directory.
- `--ignore`
    - Ignore all directories with these names.
    - _default_: `target`.
- `--create`
    - Creates test files if they don't exist.

### Calling `install`

This command can be used to quickly install other tools needed for smart contract development, interaction and testing.

Parameters:
- `all`
    - Installs all the known tools.
- `mx-scenario-go`
    - Installs the `mx-scenario-go` tool.
    - Can further specify the framework version on which the contracts should be created by using `--tag`

## Individual contract CLI

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `abi`

ABI generation can be triggered by calling `sc-meta all abi` or `cargo run abi` in the contract root folder. This command generates the main ABI file of the contract (`<contract>.abi.json`) along with all the other json files created if `#[esdt_attribute("name", type)]` was used (`<name>.esdt-abi.json`). You can read more about ESDT Attribute ABI [here](/developers/data/abi#esdt-attribute-abi).

ABI generation will also be triggered for all the other contract commands, such as `build`, `build-dbg`, `update`, etc. The `abi` command is for when we just want to generate the ABI and do nothing else.

For a simple contract such as:

```rust title=lib.rs
#[multiversx_sc::contract]
#[esdt_attribute("myTicker", u64)]
pub trait SomeContract {
    #[init]
    fn init(&self) {}
}
```

The produced files are:

```text
output
├── myTicker.esdt-abi.json
└── some_contract.abi.json
```

Arguments:

- `--path` Used to specify a target directory where to call all contract meta crates. Will be current directory if not specified.
- `--ignore` Followed by a name is used to ignore all directories with these names [default: `target`].
- `--no-abi-git-version` Skips loading the Git version into the ABI
- `--target-dir-meta` For the meta crates, allows specifying the target directory where the Rust compiler will build the intermediary files. Sharing the same target directory can speed up building multiple contract crates at once.
- `--target-dir-all` Overrides both the `--target-dir-meta` and the `--target-dir-wasm` args.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `build`

A build can be triggered by calling either `sc-meta all build` or `cargo run build` in the meta crate of the contract. In fact, the standalone `sc-meta` tool simply forwards the command to the contract meta crate itself.

By default, this command will produce three files for each output contract: the ABI (`<contract>.abi.json`), the contract (`<contract>.wasm`) and a json file with all the used VM EI imported functions (`<contract>.imports.json`). For the multisig example above, the produced files are as follows:

```text
output
├── multisig-full.abi.json
├── multisig-full.imports.json
├── multisig-full.wasm
├── multisig-view.abi.json
├── multisig-view.imports.json
├── multisig-view.wasm
├── multisig.abi.json
├── multisig.imports.json
└── multisig.wasm
```

Arguments:

- `--locked` Uses the version from `Cargo.lock`, without updating. Required for reproducible builds.
- `--wasm-name` followed by name: Replaces the main contract's name with this one. Does nothing for secondary contracts.
- `--wasm-suffix` followed by a suffix: Adds a dash and this suffix to all produced contracts. E.g. `cargo run build --wasm-suffix dbg` on multisig will produce contracts `multisig-dbg.wasm`, `multisig-view-dbg.wasm` and `multisig-full-dbg.wasm`.
- `--wasm-symbols` Does not optimize away symbols at compile time, retains function names, good for investigating the WAT.
- `--no-wasm-opt` Does not apply `wasm-opt` after the build, this retains function names, good for investigating the WAT.
- `--wat` Also generates a WAT file for each of the contract outputs. It does so by calling `wasm2wat`.
- `--mir` Also emit MIR files when building.
- `--llvm-ir` Also emit LL (LLVM) files when building.
- `--no-abi-git-version` Skips loading the Git version into the ABI.
- `--no-imports` Does not generate an EI imports JSON file for each contract, as is the default.
- `--target-dir-wasm` Allows specifying the target directory where the Rust compiler will build the intermediary files. Sharing the same target directory can speed up building multiple contract crates at once.
- `--target-dir` Synonym of `--wasm-target-dir`, used for backwards compatibility.
- `--twiggy-top` Generate a twiggy top report after building.
- `--twiggy-paths` Generate a twiggy paths report after building.
- `--twiggy-monos` Generate a twiggy monos report after building.
- `--twiggy-dominators` Generate a twiggy dominators report after building.

Additional parameters are inherited from `all`, when running out of the standalone tool:
- `--target-dir-meta` For the meta crates, allows specifying the target directory where the Rust compiler will build the intermediary files.
- `--target-dir-all` Overrides both the `--target-dir-meta` and the `--target-dir-wasm` args.

### Calling `build-dbg`

There is another command, provided for convenience: `cargo run build-dbg`. Calling this is equivalent to `cargo run build --wasm-symbols --no-wasm-opt --wasm-suffix "dbg" --wat --no-imports`. It is ideal for developers who want to investigate the WebAssembly output produced by the compiler.

The output for `build-dbg` in the multisig example would be:

```text
output
├── multisig.abi.json
├── multisig-dbg.wasm
├── multisig-dbg.wat
├── multisig-full.abi.json
├── multisig-full-dbg.wasm
├── multisig-full-dbg.wat
├── multisig-view.abi.json
├── multisig-view-dbg.wasm
└── multisig-view-dbg.wat
```

It accepts all the arguments from `build`, so `--target-dir` works here too.

### Calling `twiggy`

This command is similar to `build-dbg`, in that it provides a shorthand for building contracts and analyzing their size. It is equivalent to running `cargo run build-dbg --twiggy-top --twiggy-paths --twiggy-monos --twiggy-dominators`.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `clean`

Calling `sc-meta all clean` in the contract folder will remove all build artifacts, including the `output` folder.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Calling `snippets`

Calling `cargo run snippets` in the meta crate or `sc-meta all snippets` in the root crate will create a project called `interactor` in the contract main directory, containing auto-generated boilerplate code for building an interactor for the current contract.

An interactor is a small tool, meant for developers to interact with the contract on-chain and write system tests. Being written in Rust, it is ideal for quick interactions and tinkering, directly from the contract project. 

Inside the `interactor` project there is the interactor source file called `interact_main.rs`, a `config.toml` state file containing the chain simulator config, a `config.rs` file containing the source code for parsing the config and a newly generated contract proxy (`proxy.rs`). The `sc-config.toml` file of the contract (if existent) will be updated with the newly created proxy path (to the interactor project) or created from scratch if not existent.

After calling `sc-meta all snippets` in the `factorial` smart contract crate, we get:
![img](/img/snippets_folder_structure.png)


Parameters:
- `--overwrite` Override snippets project if it already exists. Rewrites `sc-config.toml` as well, placing only interactor as proxy path.
- `--path` Target directory where to call all contract meta crates. Will be current directory if not specified.
- `--ignore` Ignore all directories with these names. [default: target]
- `--no-abi-git-version` Skips loading the Git version into the ABI.
- `--target-dir-meta` For the meta crates, allows specifying the target directory where the Rust compiler will build the intermediary files. Sharing the same target directory can speed up building multiple contract crates at once.
- `--target-dir-all` Overrides both the --target-dir-meta and the --target-dir-wasm args.

### Calling `cs`

Calling `cargo run cs` in the meta crate or `sc-meta cs` in the root crate will start the interaction with the chain simulator. In order to start an action, one must choose between the following subcommands.

Subcommands:
- `install` Pulls the latest chain simulator docker image available. This command needs Docker to be installed and running on the current machine.
- `start` Starts the chain simulator in verbose mode at `localhost:8085`.
- `stop` Stops the chain simulator.
