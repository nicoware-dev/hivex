The N+1 setup for connecting to the MultiversX Network

In order to integrate with the MultiversX Network and be able to [broadcast transactions](/integrators/creating-transactions) and [query blockchain data](/integrators/querying-the-blockchain) in an _optimized_ approach, one needs to set up an **on-premises Observing Squad**.

An Observing Squad is defined as a set of `N` **Observer Nodes** (one for each Shard, including the Metachain) plus an [**MultiversX Proxy**](/sdk-and-tools/proxy) instance which will connect to these Observers and provide an HTTP API (by delegating requests to the Observers).

:::tip
Currently the MultiversX Mainnet has 3 Shards, plus the Metachain. Therefore, the Observing Squad is composed of 4 Observers and one Proxy instance.
:::

By setting up an Observing Squad and querying the blockchain data through the Proxy, the particularities of MultiversX's sharded architecture are abstracted away. **This means that the client interacting with the Proxy does not have to be concerned about sharding at all.**

## **System requirements**

The Observing Squad can be installed on multiple machines or on a single, but more powerful machine.

In case of a single machine, our recommendation is as follows:

- 16 x CPU
- 32 GB RAM
- Disk space that can grow up to 5 TB
- 100 Mbit/s always-on Internet connection
- Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 recommended)

The recommended number of CPUs has been updated from `8` to `16` in April 2021, considering the increasing load over the network.

:::tip
These specs are only a recommendation. Depending on the load over the API or the observers, one should upgrade the machine as to keep the squad synced and with good performance.

## **Setup via the Mainnet scripts**

:::caution
`elrond-go-scripts-mainnet` are deprecated as of November 2022. Please use `mx-chain-scripts`, explained below.

## **Installation and Configuration**

The Observing Squad can be set up using the [installation scripts](/validators/nodes-scripts/config-scripts/). Within the installation process, the `DBLookupExtension` feature (required by the Hyperblock API) will be enabled by default.

Clone the installer repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-scripts
```

Edit `config/variables.cfg` accordingly. For example:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT="mainnet"
...
CUSTOM_HOME="/home/ubuntu"
CUSTOM_USER="ubuntu"
```

Additionally, you might want to set the following option, so that the logs are saved within the `logs` folder of the node:

```bash
NODE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-log-save"
```

Please check that the `CUSTOM_HOME` directory exists. Run the installation script as follows:

```bash
./script.sh observing_squad
```

After installation, 5 new `systemd` units will be available (and enabled).

Start the nodes and the Proxy using the command:

```bash
./script.sh start
```

In order to check the status of the Observing Squad, please see the section **Monitoring and trivial checks** below.

## **Upgrading the Observing Squad**

The Observing Squad can be updated using the installation scripts.

### **General upgrade procedure**

:::important
`elrond-go-scripts-mainnet` are deprecated as of November 2022. Users of these scripts have to migrate to [mx-chain-scripts](/validators/nodes-scripts/config-scripts/).
The migration guide can he found [here](/validators/nodes-scripts/install-update/#migration-from-old-scripts).
:::

In order to upgrade the Observing Squad - that is, both the Observers and the Proxy, one should issue the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/mx-chain-scripts
$ ./script.sh github_pull
$ ./script.sh stop
$ ./script.sh upgrade_squad
$ ./script.sh upgrade_proxy
$ ./script.sh start
```

After running the commands above, the upgraded Observing Squad will start again. The expected downtime is about 2-3 minutes.

## **February 2023 upgrade**

:::note
For observing squad users that still use the old `elrond-go-scripts`: since the rebranding to `MultiversX`, the scripts have been rebranded as well to `mx-chain-scripts`. 
:::

In order to upgrade the squad, you first need to migrate to the new scripts, while still running the squad via the old scripts. After that,
we'll use the new scripts to upgrade the squad.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### **How to migrate to the new scripts**

If you already migrated from `elrond-go-scripts` to `mx-chain-scripts`, you can skip this section.

Make sure you are on the same directory as the old scripts.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-scripts
$ cd mx-chain-scripts
$ ./script.sh migrate
```

The above commands should clone the new scripts and migrate the old configuration files to the new ones. You may now proceed to the next section.

### **How to upgrade to the newest version via the new scripts**

In order to upgrade the squad, we first need to stop the squad, then upgrade the squad and finally start the squad again. These steps are done by:

```bash
$ cd ~/mx-chain-scripts
$ ./script.sh github_pull
$ ./script.sh stop
$ ./script.sh upgrade_squad
$ ./script.sh upgrade_proxy
$ ./script.sh start
```

After successfully migrating to the new scripts and upgrading the squad, you can now remove the old scripts. (example: `rm -rf ~/elrond-go-scripts`)

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## **Monitoring and trivial checks**

One can monitor the running Observers using the **termui** utility (installed during the setup process itself in the `CUSTOM_HOME="/home/ubuntu"
` folder), as follows:

```bash
~/elrond-utils/termui --address localhost:8080    # Shard 0
~/elrond-utils/termui --address localhost:8081    # Shard 1
~/elrond-utils/termui --address localhost:8082    # Shard 2
~/elrond-utils/termui --address localhost:8083    # Metachain
```

Alternatively, one can query the status of the Observers by performing GET requests using **curl**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/node/status | jq    # Shard 0
curl http://localhost:8081/node/status | jq    # Shard 1
curl http://localhost:8082/node/status | jq    # Shard 2
curl http://localhost:8083/node/status | jq    # Metachain
```

The Proxy does not offer a **termui** monitor, but its activity can be inspected using **journalctl**:

```bash
journalctl -f -u elrond-proxy.service
```

Optionally, one can perform the following smoke test in order to fetch the latest synchronized hyperblock:

```bash
export NONCE=$(curl http://localhost:8079/network/status/4294967295 | jq '.data["status"]["erd_highest_final_nonce"]')
curl http://localhost:8079/hyperblock/by-nonce/$NONCE | jq

```

## **Setup via Docker**

The Observing Squad can be also set up using Docker.

Clone the Observing Squad repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-observing-squad.git
```

Install docker-compose if not already installed:

```bash
apt install docker-compose
```

Install and run the whole Observing Squad using the `./start_stack.sh` script from the mainnet folder:

```bash
cd mainnet
./start_stack.sh
```

In order to check if the Observing Squad is running, you can list the running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

In order to check the status inside a container, you can check the logs on the machine for the last synchronized block nonce:

```bash
docker exec -it 'CONTAINER ID' /bin/bash
cat logs/mx-chain-.......log
```

More detailed commands for installing, building and running an Observing Squad using Docker are described [here](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-observing-squad.git). The images (for the Proxy and for the Observers) are published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/multiversx).
