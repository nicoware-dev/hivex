title: MultiversX tools on multiple platforms
---

Generally speaking, the MultiversX tools should work on all platforms. However, platform-specific issues can occur. This page aims to be an entry point for troubleshooting platform-specific issues, in regards to the MultiversX toolset.

:::note
If you discover a platform-specific issue, please let us known, on the [corresponding GitHub repository](/sdk-and-tools/overview).

If you are blocked by a platform-specific issue, please consider using a **devcontainer**, as described [here](/sdk-and-tools/devcontainers).

## Linux

All tools are expected to work on Linux. They are generally tested on Ubuntu-based distributions.

## MacOS

All tools are expected to work on MacOS. Though, even if the tests within the continuous integration flows cover MacOS, some inconveniences might still occur.

### Apple Silicon (M1, M2)

As of February 2024, the Node can only be compiled using the AMD64 version of Go. Thus, dependent tools, such as [localnets](/developers/setup-local-testnet), the [Chain Simulator](/sdk-and-tools/chain-simulator) etc. will rely on the [Apple Rosetta binary translator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)).

:::note
As of February 2024, a native ARM64 version of the Node is in the works. This will allow the dependent tools to run natively on Apple Silicon.
:::

If you'd like to manually build a Go tool that only works on AMD64 (for now), download & extract the Go toolchain for AMD64. For example:

```sh
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.7.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xf go1.20.7.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
```

Then, export `GOPATH` and `GOENV` variables into your shell:

```sh
export GOPATH=/(path to extracted toolchain)/go
export GOENV=/(path to extracted toolchain)/go/env
```

Afterwards, build the tools, as needed. The obtained binaries will be AMD64, and they will run on your ARM64 system.

## Windows

Some tools can be difficult to install or run **directly on Windows**. For example, when building smart contracts, the encountered issues might be harder to tackle, especially for beginners. 

Therefore, we recommend using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), instead of running the tools directly on Windows.
