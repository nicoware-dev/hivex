## VSCode: fix configuration for Rust Analyzer

If `rust-analyzer` is not working properly on VSCode, you might see (one of) the following error messages:

```
 - rust-analyzer failed to load workspace: Failed to load the project.
 - Failed to query rust toolchain version.
 - error: rustup could not choose a version of cargo to run, because one wasn't specified explicitly, and no default is configured.
```

If so, **[make sure Rust is properly installed](/sdk-and-tools/troubleshooting/rust-setup)**.

Then, restart VSCode. Now, `rust-analyzer` should work properly. If the problem persists, please [contact us](/developers/overview).
