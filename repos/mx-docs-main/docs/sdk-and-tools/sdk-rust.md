## Rust Interactors

The Rust SDK for interacting with the blockchain comes in the form of the so-called [**Rust Interactors**](/developers/meta/interactor/interactors-overview).

Since they use very similar syntax to smart contracts and smart contract tests, their documentation is grouped under the Rust Development Framework section.
