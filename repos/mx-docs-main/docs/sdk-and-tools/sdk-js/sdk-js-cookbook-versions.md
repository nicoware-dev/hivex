This page lists all available versions of the **sdk-js cookbook**. 

The cookbook version corresponds to the version of the [**sdk-js-core**](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-core) package, even though other satellite packages of **sdk-js** have separate versioning.

Please follow the version you are interested in:

- [Cookbook v13 **(stable, current version)**](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-cookbook-v13)
- [Cookbook v12 **(legacy, previous version)**](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-cookbook-v12)
