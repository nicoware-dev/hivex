## `sdk-py`: the Python library

:::note
The `multiversx-sdk` package is a unification of the previous packages (`multiversx-sdk-core`, `multiversx-sdk-wallet` and `multiversx-sdk-network-providers`). This is the package that **should** be used from now on. All the upcoming updates will come only to this package. The older packages will no longer receive updates and will soon be deprecated.
