On-chain metrics show 3.2x increase in developer activity for [redacted] protocol - typically precedes major announcement\n\n4. Abnormal options activity suggesting smart money positioning for upside in next 14 days\n\nRecommended action: Consider increasing exposure to EGLD and related ecosystem tokens with strict risk management (3-5% position sizing). Monitor governance voting closely."

Similar launches on other L1s saw initial LPs achieve 3-5x returns within first month.\n\nStrategy: Prepare capital allocation now, set calendar alert for launch, and be ready to provide liquidity within first 2 hours of deployment for maximum yield capture."
