Royalty percentage (if any)\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through the deployment process. Would you also like information about estimated gas costs in EGLD for deployment?"

During deployment, you'll specify a royalty percentage (typically 2.5-10%)\n2. You'll provide the wallet address that will receive the royalties\n3. The royalty is automatically enforced by MultiversX NFT marketplaces\n\nImportant considerations:\n- The standard royalty implementation follows EIP-2981\n- Royalties are calculated on the sale price and paid in the currency used for the sale\n- Maximum royalty percentage allowed is 15% on most MultiversX marketplaces\n- Royalties only apply to secondary sales, not the initial mint\n\nWould you like me to help you implement royalties for your collection? I can guide you through the specific parameters needed in your deployment transaction."
