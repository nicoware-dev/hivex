# MultiversX Blockchain Resources and Documentation

MultiversX is a high-performance, sharded smart contract blockchain designed for the Web3 era with capacity to serve Web2 needs. It achieves over 30,000 TPS with adaptive scalability, offering fast and low-cost transactions. For comprehensive information, visit [MultiversX Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/).

MultiversX's architecture delivers high throughput with optimized performance through its Adaptive State Sharding mechanism and Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus. The platform provides developers with a robust framework for creating sophisticated decentralized applications, specifically designed for scalability and security.

## Wallet Ecosystem

The MultiversX Wallet ecosystem supports multiple wallet types:

- **xPortal**: Mobile wallet for iOS and Android
- **DeFi Wallet**: Browser extension for desktop use
- **Maiar**: Another wallet option in the ecosystem

For detailed wallet information, see [MultiversX Wallet Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/overview).

## EGLD Token

EGLD (eGold) is the native token of MultiversX and serves multiple functions:

- Paying for transactions and smart contract operations
- Transferring value and assets
- Creating and managing tokens
- Staking to secure the network

EGLD has a maximum theoretical supply of 31,415,926 tokens, with an innovative mechanism where inflation is offset by transaction fees. For token details, visit [EGLD Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/tokens/egld).

## ESDT Tokens

MultiversX Standard Digital Token (ESDT) is the token standard on MultiversX. Unlike Ethereum's ERC-20 which requires smart contracts, ESDT tokens are managed directly by the protocol, making them more efficient and cost-effective. Learn more at [ESDT Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/tokens/esdt-tokens).

## xExchange

xExchange is the main decentralized exchange (DEX) on MultiversX, allowing users to:
- Swap tokens
- Provide liquidity
- Participate in yield farming

It functions similarly to Uniswap on Ethereum, using automated market makers (AMMs) to facilitate trades. For more information, visit [xExchange Documentation](https://docs.xexchange.com/).

## Hatom Protocol

Hatom Protocol is a lending and borrowing platform on MultiversX, enabling users to:
- Earn interest by lending assets
- Borrow against collateral
- Manage lending positions

It's similar to Aave or Compound on Ethereum. Learn more at [Hatom Protocol](https://hatom.com/).

## Staking

MultiversX supports staking, allowing EGLD holders to delegate their tokens to validators and earn rewards. This process helps secure the network while providing passive income to token holders. For staking details, visit [Staking Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/validators/staking).

## Developer Resources

MultiversX provides extensive resources for developers:

- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK: [MultiversX JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@multiversx/sdk-js)
- REST API: [MultiversX API](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/rest-api/multiversx-api/)
- Smart Contract Development: [SC Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/overview)

The blockchain uses WebAssembly (WASM) for smart contracts, offering better performance and security compared to EVM-based chains.

## MultiversX Explorer

[MultiversX Explorer](https://explorer.multiversx.com/) provides a comprehensive view of the blockchain, allowing users to:
- Track transactions
- View account balances
- Monitor network statistics

It's an essential tool for developers and users alike.

## Community and Governance

MultiversX has a community-driven governance system, with proposals and voting mechanisms that allow stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes. Community engagement happens through:
