MultiversX is a high-performance, sharded smart contract blockchain with Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus, designed for the Web3 era with capacity to serve Web2 needs. At the time of writing, it achieves over 30,000 TPS with adaptive scalability, offering fast and low-cost transactions.

MultiversX, formerly known as Elrond, is a distributed blockchain network for next-gen applications. It's decentralized via 3,000+ nodes, scalable through sharding, and designed to be fast, secure, and environmentally friendly.

The MultiversX blockchain uses a native token called EGLD (eGold), which serves multiple purposes in the ecosystem. EGLD is used to pay for transactions and smart contract operations, transfer value and assets, create and manage tokens, and is earned by validators who run and secure the network.

EGLD has a maximum theoretical supply of 31,415,926 EGLD. In the bootstrapping phase, 20,000,000 EGLD coins were initially minted, with additional EGLD gradually released into circulation over 10 years until the maximum limit is reached. The EGLD minting (inflation) is offset by transaction fees - if 100,000 EGLD are to be minted in Year X, but network-wide transaction fees for that year are 75,000 EGLD, only 25,000 new EGLD will enter circulation.

MultiversX uses ESDT (MultiversX Standard Digital Token) for creating and managing tokens on the blockchain. Unlike Ethereum's ERC-20 standard which requires smart contracts, ESDT tokens are managed directly by the protocol, making them more efficient and cost-effective.

The MultiversX wallet ecosystem includes xPortal (mobile wallet), DeFi Wallet (browser extension), and Maiar, providing users with multiple options for managing their assets and interacting with the blockchain.

xExchange is the main decentralized exchange (DEX) on MultiversX, allowing users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and participate in yield farming. It functions similarly to Uniswap on Ethereum, using automated market makers (AMMs) to facilitate trades.

Hatom Protocol is a lending and borrowing platform on MultiversX, enabling users to earn interest by lending their assets or borrow against their collateral. It's similar to Aave or Compound on Ethereum.

MultiversX supports staking, allowing EGLD holders to delegate their tokens to validators and earn rewards. This process helps secure the network while providing passive income to token holders.

The MultiversX ecosystem includes a rich set of developer tools and SDKs, including JavaScript/TypeScript libraries, making it accessible for developers to build decentralized applications. The blockchain uses WebAssembly (WASM) for smart contracts, offering better performance and security compared to EVM-based chains.

MultiversX Explorer provides a comprehensive view of the blockchain, allowing users to track transactions, view account balances, and monitor network statistics. It's an essential tool for developers and users alike.

MultiversX has a strong focus on interoperability, with bridges to other blockchains like Ethereum, enabling assets to move between different networks. This expands the utility of the MultiversX ecosystem and allows for cross-chain applications.

The governance of MultiversX is community-driven, with proposals and voting mechanisms that allow stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes that affect the network's future.

MultiversX's architecture is designed for enterprise use cases, with features like privacy, compliance, and scalability that make it suitable for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology.

The MultiversX API provides developers with a way to interact with the blockchain programmatically, offering endpoints for retrieving account information, transaction data, and network statistics.

For developers, MultiversX offers a robust framework with comprehensive documentation, making it an ideal platform for building sophisticated decentralized applications with features that would be difficult or impossible to implement on other blockchains.
